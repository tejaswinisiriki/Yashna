Attendance, or the act of being present, is crucial for success in various settings, particularly education and work, as it allows for active participation, learning, and connection with peers and colleagues. Consistent attendance leads to better academic performance, improved social skills, character development, and a stronger sense of community, while absences, even excused ones, can result in falling behind, missing opportunities, and negatively impacting both personal development and overall school or workplace efficiency.
